        <h2>SEO Techniques</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Write Compelling Title and Description Tags</li>
            <p>A useful SEO Technique can be using compelling titles and description tags. To maximize the potential of this technique, <br>it's good to use competitive keywords similar to those used in ads that appear in the SERPS. This will result in more organic clicks <br>which will make your Google Ranking higher and result in your website appearing near the top of the search results. </p>
            <li>Copy Your Competitors Best Keywords</li>
            <p>Another useful SEO Technique is to emulate or create something similar to your competitors' pages that bring in the most traffic.<br> By doing this you can see what is included in their pages that you can also include in yours to increase website traffic. This could<br> be the type of content that's in the page, the length of the content, or even the usage of images and multimedia.</p>
            <li>Improve Your Organic CTR via title and meta description tags</li>
            <p>I found this to be very interesting because it's something we learned in class, and is pretty easy to implement into websites. <br/>To improve click-through rate organically, adding a relevant title tag and meta description tag to your website will boost CTR.<br> Including keywords that other websites within title and description tags is essential to boosting website traffic. By using this technique<br/> my website ranking may improve and become more visible to the public.</p>
        </ol>
        <h2>SMO Techniques</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Use Hashtags</li>
            <p>I found the usage of hashtags to be interesting because they're the SEO of well-known social media platforms. By using hashtags,<br/> your content will have an increased chance of being viewed; will help the platform algorithm push your content out to people. <br/>Good examples of this is using #fyp in Instagram reels and TikTok video captions to get your video on the For You Page.</p>
            <li>Use Images</li>
            <p>Using images as an SMO technique is good for garnering attention from users. Images add variety and context to the content provided<br/> to people who visit your social media account. Images can also provide interactivity, such as Instagram posts, that would increase<br/> account traffic. When you post an image on Instagram, there's a comment section where people can interact with the poster and other <br/>commentors. I feel like images could provide more variety to my website, and therefore result in more website traffic.</p>
            <li>Create Valuable content</li>
            <p>I could apply this SMO technique to my website as it focuses on gaining attention from users via content. I would say this is the most<br/> valuable technique because it gives your audience value, and therefore a reason to come back and share your website/page.<br/> It's also proven that if content evokes emotion out of users, they're most likely to like, share and comment on your content.</p>
